## Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

Now that I've finished this course, I feel that while it was a good gentle intro, it isn't intensive at all. The programming quizzes with test cases were nice because I find it more motivating to do quizzes when they're in a format that gives me feedback on my answers, but the test cases were also quite weak and just checked that what I was printing to the console was correct. However, I can't expect too much out of a free course and I am grateful that somebody put some effort into making this. Once it got to red black trees, some graph traversal, and case studies, the quizzes dried up. I would not recommend this course for interview prep or focused learning--it is much more like a quick taster of concepts. 

However, this has given me some insight into what I can target next. I am working through UPenn's CIS110 at the moment of writing this (Apr 2019) and will look around for algorithms courses that provide me with test cases and quizzy formats to continue leveraging my laziness in this direction. 

## What I previously wrote about 3 months ago:
This is a Udacity class that I was marginally curious about as a way to continue supplementing my algorithms/DS practice. At this point, MIT 6.00.1x has been very helpful for an introduction to Python, and MIT 6.00.2x gave me a little taste of graphs. 

I am still working through Elements of Programming Interviews, but at times the difficulty level of the problems is quite high and I want something a bit more intermediate. I'm not sure that this class will be exactly what I'm looking for, but I will finish it and consume more material as necessary. MIT's OCW Algorithm's course might also be worth trying out after this. 

Lastly, I plan to also get around to reading Sedgewick's Algorithms once I decide to jump into Java.
