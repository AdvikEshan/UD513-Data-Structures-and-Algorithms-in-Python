## Data Structures and Algorithms in Python
This is a Udacity class that I was marginally curious about as a way to continue supplementing my algorithms/DS practice. At this point, MIT 6.00.1x has been very helpful for an introduction to Python, and MIT 6.00.2x gave me a little taste of graphs. 

I am still working through Elements of Programming Interviews, but at times the difficulty level of the problems is quite high and I want something a bit more intermediate. I'm not sure that this class will be exactly what I'm looking for, but I will finish it and consume more material as necessary. MIT's OCW Algorithm's course might also be worth trying out after this. 

Lastly, I plan to also get around to reading Sedgewick's Algorithms once I decide to jump into Java.
